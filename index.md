## About

I'm a third-year at UC San Diego majoring in Data Science and minoring in Hebrew Language and Literature.

I'm currently a data science intern at the [San Diego County Sheriff's Department](https://www.sdsheriff.gov/) where I'm working on super cool projects involving real-world data. 

I'm also an Instructional Assistant for [DSC 10](https://dsc10.com/), the largest Data Science course at UC San Diego, where I help introduce students to the exciting field of Data Science!

In my free time I enjoy working out, trying new food, and playing music.
