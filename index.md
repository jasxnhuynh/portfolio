## About

I'm a fourth-year Data Science major at UC San Diego, minoring in Hebrew Language and Literature.

Currently, I'm a Data Engineer Intern at [Lockheed Martin Space](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/who-we-are/business-areas/space.html).

In the past, I was a Data Science Intern at the [San Diego County Sheriff's Office](https://www.sdsheriff.gov/), where I migrated on-premises data to the Azure Government Cloud and created pretty Power BI reports.

I’ve also had the privilege of being an Instructional Assistant for [DSC 10](https://dsc10.com/), UC San Diego’s largest Data Science course, as well as [DSC 80](https://dsc80.com).

In my free time I enjoy working out, bouldering, and exploring San Diego.
